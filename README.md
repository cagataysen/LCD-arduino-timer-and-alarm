# LCD-arduino-timer-and-alarm

  On the circuit there are 4 buttons (B1, B2, B3, B4). B1 changes the format of time which are 24h-12h. While changing to 12h system automatically a.m. and p.m. formats come to the LCD screen. 

  Also, there is an implementation alarm system for both formats, so we can set the alarm by using two different formats. 


    -B2 enables/disables the alarm. If it is on, on the lcd screen we see O, otherwise X. 
    
    -B3 changes the unit of temperature which are Fahrenheit and Celsius. Also, while setting the alarm and time we can increase the digits 1 by 1 using B3. 
    
    -B4 stops the alarm when it snoozes. 
    
    -If we press to B1 3 seconds according to tinkercad time we can set the current time. As mentioned above we can increase the current time by pressing the B3. 
    
    -If we press B2 3 seconds, we can start to set alarm and pressing to B3 we can increase the number.
